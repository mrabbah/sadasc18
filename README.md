# Python In Real Time Application For Mobile Robot Uses cases
----------------------------
A real-time computer system needs both an operating system that operates in real-time and user code that delivers deterministic execution. Both deterministic user code on a non-real-time operating system, or nondeterministic code on a real-time operating system will result in real-time performance. In this repository we proposed some best practices and design pattern to overcome this difficulty, espacially while developping with Python.
The following guide describe the points that must be taken in considreation and also the best practices [PYTHON REAL TIME GUIDE](RT_PYTHON_GUIDE.ipynb) pour tout apprendre à partir de Zéro !
