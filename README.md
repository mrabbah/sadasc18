# Python In Real Time Application For Mobile Robot Uses cases
----------------------------
A real-time computer system needs both an operating system that operates in real-time and user code that delivers deterministic execution. 

Both deterministic user code on a non-real-time operating system, or nondeterministic code on a real-time operating system will result in real-time performance. 

In this [guide](RT_PYTHON_GUIDE.ipynb) we presented major problem that face developers to write a real time application, and also we proposed some best practices and design pattern to overcome this difficulty, some of them are general to any application, other are specific to Python programming language. 

This work will be reference for all developers that will contribute to Collaborative Open Platform for Decentralized Artificial Intelligence [(COPDAI)](http://www.copdai.org) middleware development process.
