# Python In Real Time Application For Mobile Robot Uses cases
## Abstract
A real-time computer system needs both an operating system that operates in real-time and user code that delivers deterministic execution. Both deterministic user code on a non-real-time operating system, or nondeterministic code on a real-time operating system will result in real-time performance. In this repository we proposed some best practices and design pattern to overcome this difficulty, espacially while developping with Python.
