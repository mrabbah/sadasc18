    "The first problem we encountered while developing a RT application using Python is the garbage collector (GC). Python’s stop-the-world garbage collector makes latency non deterministic. When python decides it needs to run the garbage collector, the program gets stopped until it finishes. we will use the design pattern Decorator to inject to dismiss the GC before running critical section: First we call gc.disable() function, after that we add gc.set_threshold(0), the second instruction will prevent any third-party libraries calling gc.enable() during execution time, and so no libraries can brought the GC back. At The end of Node execution, we want the GC to clean up the memory, so we will register “os._exit” function throw the Decorator like this:"

    "the third category of problems we can face when developing a RT application are:\n",
    "* Latency: We must guarantee that our process doesn’t be pre-empted while dealing with a critical event, and we must also guarantee the latency of a process. \n",
    "* Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Another notorious problem (at least for the standard CPython implementation of Python) is the GIL. The GIL prevent multiple python thread execute same code at the same time, so there are one GIL for each interpreter, allowing reference count being changed concurrently, the down side is in Python program, no matter how many threads exist, only one thread will be executed at a time, which means any attempt at using multithreading in order to gain concurrency benefits will be futile.\n",
    "* Copy-on-Write (CoW): Linux kernel has a mechanism called CoW that serves as an optimization for forked processes. A child process starts by sharing every memory page with its parent. A page copied to the child’s memory space only when the page is written to, because of reference counting, every time we read a Python object, the interpreter will increase its refcount, which is essentially a write to its underlying data structure. This causes CoW and leads to page faults.\n",
    "The proposed solutions for each problem are:\n",
    "* Solving the latency problem: At the constructor level, we will indicate if yes or no this task is real time, also it takes as optional parameters: the scheduling policy and the priority, we can get the Node process name throw __file__ attribute, and after that use the subprocess.check_output to retrieve the process ID, setting the priority and the scheduling policy.\n",
    "* To avoid the GIL problem, each actuator or sensor will be presented in COPDAI as Node. So, we will have just one process per task, and no need to use multithreading, against we will use multiprocessing, and so avoid the GIL downside\n",
    "* To avoid the CoW problem, we will not use the default python multiprocessing library, despite each node must be in a separate file, and we will lunch each file by calling subprocess.Popen(['python3','nodes.py'])\n",
